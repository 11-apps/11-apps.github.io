# Why Astro?

Astro is a web framework designed for speed. It ships zero JavaScript to the client by default, which makes it perfect for a blog like this.

## Key Features

1. **Zero JS by default**: Astro renders HTML on the server and strips away any unused JavaScript.
2. **Islands Architecture**: You can interactive components (like React or Svelte) only where you need them.
3. **Content Collections**: Type-safe content management is built-in.

This blog uses:
- **Astro** for the core framework
- **React** for interactive components (if needed)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

It's a great stack for building performant, maintainable websites.
